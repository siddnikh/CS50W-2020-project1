# Project 1 - Wiki

This is the first project of the specialization course by Harvard, CS50W. 
We use Django framework to design a very small web application which is arguably a BAD replica of WikiPedia. Call it the poor man's Wikipedia.
Meh, whatever xD

Just in case you're interested in the problem and think you can do it in a better manner (which is very much possible), go ahead and check the problem out!

Also, this is my first time using Django, it was fun :P xD
